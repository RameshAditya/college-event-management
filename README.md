# Event Management System for Colleges
This repo contains the specific webpages which depict an event management system that allows students and faculty members to schedule, arrange and attend events, meetings, workshops, and conferences. 

The given system can be generalized and implemented for other colleges, however the implementation present here is compatible with Vellore Institute of Technology's (VIT) Student Portal - VTOP (https://vtop.vit.ac.in/student/stud_login.asp)
